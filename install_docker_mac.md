Installation with Docker
================================================================================

- Run the script install_docker.sh. This script is important because it installs the docker client on your machine and adds to your user the privileges to run the docker images, and create a new folder.


```
$sudo apt install curl
$curl -o install_docker.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/idra-lab/loco_nav/refs/heads/master/docker/loco_nav/install_docker.sh
$sudo chmod +x install_docker.sh
$./install_docker.sh
```
- If everything went smooth you should read: **To start docker, reboot the system!** You can now restart the PC so that all changes made can be applied.
- If you look into your **host** Ubuntu home directory, you will see that the **trento_lab_home** directory has been created with **/ros_ws/src** subfolders.
- now you can clone the loco_nav code inside the  **trento_lab_home/ros_ws/src** folder


```
$ cd ~/trento_lab_home/ros_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/idra-lab/loco_nav.git
```

**NOTE:**  when you clone the code, be sure to have a stable and fast connection. Before continuing, be sure you properly checked out **all** the submodules without any error.

- Now you should compile the docker image yourself for ARM:

  ```
  cd ~/trento_lab_home/ros_ws/src/loco_nav/docker/loco_nav
  docker build --platform linux/arm64  -t mfocchi/trento_lab_framework:loco_nav -f Dockerfile .
  ```
  
- Now, you need to configure the bash environment of your Ubuntu machine as follows. Open the `.zshrc` file from your home folder:


```
$ gedit ~/.zshrc
```

- Make sure **XQuartz → Preferences → Security → “Allow connections from network clients”** is checked
- and add the following lines at the bottom of the file:

```bash
alias lab_planning='xhost +127.0.0.1; \
docker rm -f docker_container >/dev/null 2>&1 || true; \
docker run --name docker_container \
  --workdir="/root"  -it \
  --device=/dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0 \
  --volume="$HOME/trento_lab_home:/root" \
  --env="DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0" \
  --privileged --shm-size=2g --rm \
  mfocchi/trento_lab_framework:loco_nav'
alias dock-other='docker exec -it docker_container /bin/bash'
```

- Load the .zshrc script (next time you will open a terminal this will be automatically loaded).


```
$ source ~/.zshrc
```

- Open a terminal and run the "lab_planning" alias:

```
$ lab_planning
```

- You should see your terminal change from `user@hostname` to `user@docker`. 
- the **lab_planning** script will mount the folder `~/trento_lab_home` on your **host** computer. Inside of all of the docker images this folder is mapped to `$HOME`.This means that any files you place   in your docker $HOME folder will survive the stop/starting of a new docker container. All other files and installed programs will disappear on the next run. 
- The alias **lab_planning** needs to be called only ONCE and opens the image. To link other terminals to the same image you should run **dock-other**, this second command will "**attach**" to the image opened previously by calling the **lab_planning** alias.  You can call **lab_planning** only once and **dock-other** as many times you need to open multiple terminals.



# Compiling the code

- Now you can compile the ROS workspace in the $HOME directory **inside** docker:


```
$ cd  /root/ros_ws/
$ catkin_make install
```

- Only once, after the first compilation do:	

```
$ source /root/ros_ws/install/setup.bash
```

**NOTE:**  when you run the code, if an error pops-up that tells you a recently compiled package cannot be found you need to run:

```
$ rospack profile
```

This function crawls through the packages in ROS_ROOT  and ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, read and parse  the package.xml for each package, and  assemble a complete dependency tree  for all packages.

Now you are ready to run the code as explained  [here](https://github.com/idra-lab/locosim?tab=readme-ov-file#running-the-software-from-python-ide-pycharm).

When you have finished exit from the container typing:  

```
$ exit
```



# **Committing the image** (optional)

To install new packages open a terminal and call the apt install **without** sudo. To store the changes in the local image, get the ASH (a number) of the active container with:

```powershell
$ docker ps 
```

14. Commit the docker image (next time you will open an new container it will retain the changes done to the image without loosing them):

```powershell
$ docker commit ASH mfocchi/trento_lab_framework:introrob
```
